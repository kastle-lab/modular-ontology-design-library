### First Steps

This repository contains a git `pre-commit` hook necessary to create automated documentations.  
Before creating a first commit, please ensure that you have run this command first.

```bash
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

The command will add the `.githooks` directory to git's hooks path and use it.
